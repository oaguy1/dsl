DSL - Dave's Scheme Library
===========================

I am writing this library as a means of teaching myself statistics and AI for
machine learning. Why *Scheme*? Because I am a masochist, and because I truly
believe LISP style languages are beautiful.

## Whats in it?

Nothing right now, but I plan on adding the contents of each module here as I
write more.
